This project is called VmDec. It includes CRUDASM, a disassembler developed by Willow Schlanger from scratch as well as a small 8086 compatible PC emulator that runs DOS and a partial Win32 EXE decompiler. It is a work in progress.

**NOTE**  CRUDASM development has moved to sourceforge because Google Code stopped allowing for new downloads to be added.

The latest version of CRUDASM can be found on the new sourceforge page here:
